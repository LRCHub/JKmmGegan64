[00:05.10] Can you feel that?
[00:14.10] 
[00:10.16] Oh shit
[00:13.66] 
[00:20.81] Ooh ah ah ah ah
[00:28.31] 
[00:31.98] Ooh ah ah ah ah
[00:39.48] 
[00:43.14] Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
[00:48.49] Broken your servant I kneel
[00:52.71] (Will you give it to me?)
[00:54.34] It seems what's left of my human side
[00:58.33] Is slowly changing in me
[01:10.33] 
[01:02.61] (Will you give it to me?)
[01:05.06] Looking at my own reflection
[01:08.27] When suddenly it changes
[01:10.65] Violently it changes
[01:13.52] Oh no, there is no turning back now
[01:31.02] 
[01:19.47] You've woken up the demon in me
[01:26.82] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[01:28.80] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[01:31.63] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[01:34.33] Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
[01:37.57] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[01:39.69] You mother get up
[01:40.70] Come on get down with the sickness
[01:57.70] 
[01:42.31] You fucker get up
[01:44.22] Come on get down with the sickness
[01:45.02] Madness is the gift, that has been given to me
[02:08.02] 
[01:53.31] I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
[01:57.89] Don't try to deny what you feel
[02:02.97] (Will you give it to me?)
[02:15.47] 
[02:03.97] It seems that all that was good has died
[02:07.94] And is decaying in me
[02:13.52] (Will you give it to me?)
[02:14.67] It seems you're having some trouble
[02:17.82] In dealing with these changes
[02:32.32] 
[02:20.52] Living with these changes
[02:23.15] Oh no, the world is a scary place
[02:27.94] Now that you've woken up the demon in me
[02:35.71] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[02:38.15] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[02:40.89] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[02:43.43] Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
[02:46.17] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[03:07.17] 
[02:48.85] You mother get up
[02:49.70] Come on get down with the sickness
[02:51.43] You fucker get up
[02:52.56] Come on get down with the sickness
[02:53.68] Madness is the gift, that has been given to me
[03:16.68] 
[03:01.15] And when I dream
[03:04.87] And when I dream
[03:12.87] 
[03:05.90] And when I dream
[03:06.17] And when I dream
[03:06.44] No mommy, don't do it again
[03:06.70] Don't do it again
[03:06.97] I'll be a good boy
[03:07.26] I'll be a good boy, I promise
[03:07.52] No mommy don't hit me, oh-ooh
[03:07.71] Why did you have to hit me like that mommy?
[03:08.06] Don't do it! You're hurting me, oh-ooh
[03:08.31] Why did you have to be such a bitch?
[03:08.58] Why don't you, why don't you fuck off and die?
[03:08.81] Why can't you just fuck off and die?
[03:09.16] Why can't you just leave here and die?
[03:09.39] Never stick your hand in my face again bitch
[03:09.69] Fuck you
[03:13.69] 
[03:09.97] I don't need this shit
[03:10.11] You stupid sadistic abusive fucking whore
[03:10.44] How would you like to see how it feels mommy?
[03:10.71] Here it comes, get ready to die
[03:26.21] 
[03:11.22] Ooh ah ah ah ah
[03:12.88] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[03:14.71] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[03:17.35] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[03:20.05] Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
[03:23.25] Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[03:25.65] You mother get up
[03:26.48] Come on get down with the sickness
[03:27.72] You fucker get up
[03:29.92] Come on get down with the sickness
[03:30.73] Madness has now come over me
